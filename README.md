# Algorithms & Data Structures in C++

Implementations of various data structures and their associated algorithms in C++. Purpose; to understand said algorithms and data structures better so I can ace that interview!

## Quick Start

Run the test suite for each data structure by simply executing:

```
./run.sh
```

## Specs

- **Standard**: C++17
- **Compiler**: Clang
- **Default Target Architecture**: `arm64`
